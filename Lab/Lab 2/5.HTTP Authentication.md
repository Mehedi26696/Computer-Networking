## Use http-wireshark-trace5-1.pcapng

### Question 18: What is the server's response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from your browser?

#### Analysis Steps:

1. **Apply HTTP Protocol Filter**
    - Load the `http-wireshark-trace5-1.pcapng` file in Wireshark
    - Apply filter: `http` to isolate HTTP traffic
    - Examine the filtered packets for HTTP communication

#### Server Response Analysis:

The server responds with:
```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
```

**Breakdown:**
- **Status Code:** 401
- **Phrase:** Unauthorized

**Explanation:**
- The server indicates that access to `/wireshark-labs/protected_pages/HTTP-wireshark-file5.html` requires authentication
- The `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="wireshark-students only"` header instructs the browser to provide credentials
- The response body contains an HTML page explaining that access is denied

#### Answer:
- **Status Code:** 401
- **Phrase:** Unauthorized

### Question 19: When your browser's sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, what new field is included in the HTTP GET message?

#### Analysis Steps:

1. **Analyze Second HTTP GET Request**
    - Locate the second HTTP GET request packet in the filtered traffic
    - Compare headers with the initial request to identify new fields
    - Right-click → Follow → HTTP Stream for detailed view

#### New Field Analysis:

In the second HTTP GET request, the browser includes a new header field:

```
Authorization: Basic d2lyZXNoYXJrLXN0dWRlbnRzOm5ldHdvcms=
```

#### Base64 Decoding:

**Encoded Value:** `d2lyZXNoYXJrLXN0dWRlbnRzOm5ldHdvcms=`

**Decoded Value:** `wireshark-students:network`

**Breakdown:**
- **Username:** `wireshark-students`
- **Password:** `network`

#### Explanation:

1. The first request received a `401 Unauthorized` response requiring authentication
2. The browser prompts the user for credentials
3. The browser resends the GET request with the `Authorization` header containing Base64-encoded credentials
4. This allows the server to authenticate the user and serve the protected content

#### Answer:
The new field included in the second HTTP GET message is:
**Authorization: Basic d2lyZXNoYXJrLXN0dWRlbnRzOm5ldHdvcms=**

This header contains the username `wireshark-students` and password `network` encoded in Base64 format for HTTP Basic Authentication.
